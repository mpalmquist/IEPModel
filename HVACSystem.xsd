		<xs:documentation>This schema defines the parameters associated with an HVAC system.  

An HVAC system may contain any combination of the following: a heating system, a cooling system and ventilation system. Ventilation is defined here as a system that exchanges air in a conditioned zone with air outside the building.

An HVAC system may also contain an instance of a distribution system, which is used to condition (transfer heat to or from) a space.  The distribution system consists (optionally) of prime movers (pumps or fans) and segments (segments of duct or pipe, etc.).  Note that there can be only one space-serving distribution system per instance of an HVAC system.  Therefore, if multiple distribution systems serve a space, multiple HVAC systems must be defined.

An HVAC system serves a zone, however, zones reference the HVAC systems that serve them.

Note that parameters associated with the transport and movement of air and water are captured in a Distribution System.</xs:documentation>

			<xs:documentation>This schema defines the parameters associated with an HVAC system.  

An HVAC system may contain any combination of the following: a heating system, a cooling system and ventilation properties. Ventilation is defined here as the exchange of air in the space/zone with air outside.

An HVAC system references Distribution systems that serve one of three purposes:
- deliver conditioning to a space/zone.
- provide heat.
- provide cold (a fluid to reject heat to).

An HVAC system serves a zone, however, zones reference the HVAC systems that serve them.

Note that parameters associated with the transport and movement of air and water are captured in a Distribution System.

			<xs:documentation>This describes the properties of ventilation. 

Ventilation in the IEP model is defined as the exchange (inlet or exhaust) of air with the environment outside of the building. Since Delivery System defines the way in which air is transported, this object simply defines how, when and what portion of that air is inlet from or exhausted to outside.

It is not necessary to define a Delivery System in order to define ventilation. This is particularly true when the ventilation type is natural.

Ventilation should not be confused with "venting". This is not where one describes the ducting that provides conditioned air to the space/zone. This is done in the DeliverySystem.</xs:documentation>

Examples:
- Inlet, 100% outside air, fixed/variable damper
- Exhaust, fixed/variable damper
- Outside air economizer system
- Natural: Windows, manual/auto control
- Exhaust, relief vent
- Whole house fan

It may be appropriate to define the nominal (maximum, 100%) outside air flow rate, particularly when the Ventilation Control Schedule is a fraction schedule type. This would be useful when the ventilation type is natural or if no Delivery System is defined.

It may be appropriate to define the flow rate units (cubic-feet per minute) if the Ventilation Control Schedule type is a value schedule.</xs:documentation>

				<xs:annotation>
					<xs:documentation>This schedule defines when and what fraction of air is exchanged with outside. A fraction schedule type is most appropriate. The nominal (100%) flow rate would reflect the Delivery System flow rate at the given conditions.

Alternatively, if the ventilation type is natural, the user may define the maximum flow rate in the Description.

Another option would be to define a value schedule and indicate in the description what the units of the schedule values represent (i.e. cubic-feet per minute).</xs:documentation>
